# bootdata
(Crappy) Open-Source recreation of Endermanch's bootdata utility. There's no hex view <s>nor export/import options</s> yet.

(Made in 5 hours, 50% of which was me troubleshooting a dumb mistake i didn't see or windows cmd being windows cmd)

## Parameter Documentation
```
bootdatarecreation.exe export <file path>     Writes the current bootloader to a file.
bootdatarecreation.exe import <file path>     Overwrites the bootloader with contents from specified file.
```
